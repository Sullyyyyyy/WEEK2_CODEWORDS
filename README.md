Week 2:
Week 2 was about learning about Github, a place to put all our coded work for review and viewing by our peers and teachers. We learned how to make repositories that hold all the files and create a website URL with our code. This felt like a proper first step into coding and was definitely interesting to learn. We also learned about some case studies that the lecturers provided. Another task we did was to create poetry from the chosen text. We then coded that in a way that made the lettering unique.
